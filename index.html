    <h1>Pyber</h1>
    <br>
    <p>The ride sharing bonanza continues! Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, I've decided to join a fledgling ride sharing company of your own. In your latest capacity, you'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist for the company. In this role, you'll be expected to offer data-backed guidance on new opportunities for market differentiation.</p>

    <p>I built a Bubble Plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

            Average Fare ($) Per City
            Total Number of Rides Per City
            Total Number of Drivers Per City
            City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)</p>
